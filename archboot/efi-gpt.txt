Install the packages grub and efibootmgr. GRUB is the bootloader, efibootmgr creates bootable .efi stub entries used by the GRUB installation script.

The following steps install the GRUB UEFI application to $esp/EFI/grub, install its modules to /boot/grub/x86_64-efi, and place the bootable grubx64.efi stub in $esp/EFI/grub_uefi.

First, tell GRUB to use UEFI, set the boot directory and set the bootloader ID. Change $esp to your efi partition (usually /boot):

# grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=$esp --bootloader-id=grub_uefi --recheck

The bootloader id is what appears in the boot options to identity the GRUB EFI boot option; make sure this is something you will recognize later.

After the above install finished the main GRUB directory is located at /boot/grub/.

Do not forget to #Generate the main configuration file after finalizing further setup dependant #Configuration.
Note:

    While some distributions require a /boot/efi or /boot/EFI directory, Arch does not.
    --efi-directory and --bootloader-id are specific to GRUB UEFI. --efi-directory specifies the mountpoint of the ESP. It replaces --root-directory, which is deprecated. --bootloader-id specifies the name of the directory used to store the grubx64.efi file.
    You might note the absence of a <device_path> option (e.g.: /dev/sda) in the grub-install command. In fact any <device_path> provided will be ignored by the GRUB install script, as UEFI bootloaders do not use a MBR or partition boot sector at all.
