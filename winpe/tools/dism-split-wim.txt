#  Utilize split images

Dism supports the /split-image command which would allow you to split the image into pieces that are less than 4GB.
 
~~Dism /Split-Image /ImageFile:install.wim /SWMFile:install.swm /FileSize:4000~~

dism /Split-Image /ImageFile:J:\sources\install.wim /SWMFile:K:\sources\install.swm /FileSize:4000

This will create the following files (depending on size)

    install.swm

    ~~install1.swm~~

    install2.swm

~~Place all the files in a directory and use DISM /apply image~~

~~Dism /apply-image /imagefile:install.swm /swmfile:install*.swm /index:1 /applydir:D:~~
